                            <span>ABOUT ME</span>
                            <p>Deciding to pursue my Chartered Accountant designation was never just about accounting.
                                My experience at a Big Four
                                accounting firm has shown me that although the numbers are a major piece of the
                                framework for a successful business;
                                people, drive, and passion form the core. I have witnessed these pillars of success in
                                industries ranging from real
                                estate to film production, where my background primarily lies in the private sector. I
                                am amazed at how people can
                                create inspiring lives where their work and passion are one and the same, all budding
                                from one simple but genius idea.</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>I would love to help your business realize this success, as this is my passion â€“ growth. Growth in people, in business,
                                in livelihoods. Let us grow together.</p>
